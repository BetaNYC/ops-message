## How to use this repo
Until we start writing everything as markdown files, we are using this [repo's issues](https://github.com/BetaNYC/ops-message/issues) section to track and monitor tasks. Please be aware that a majority of us are using waffle.io to access these tasks. This means issues/tasks will have three primary flags: Backlog, Ready, In Progress, and Done.
