## How to use this repo
Until we start writing everything as markdown files, we are using this [repo's issues](https://github.com/BetaNYC/ops-message/issues) section to track and monitor tasks. Please be aware that a majority of us are using waffle.io to access these tasks. This means issues/tasks will have three primary flags: Backlog, Ready, In Progress, and Done.

## Screendoor / Issue documentation
Every time someone submits on the Screendoor form, an issue is created on this repo. This happens via Zapier.

1. The Zapier account that is used is the BetaNYC team account (ask Noel). All of the configuration for the task is set there (e.g. which fields get populated, who gets assigned, etc.). If you log in on Zapier, you can see the task and the template that Zapier uses to initially create the issue. Note that the Ops-CIL repo uses something similar.
2. Then, the GitHub account that actually makes the post is a bot account (ask Noel for credentials).
